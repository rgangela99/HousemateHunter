# Housemate Hunter
Connecting current and former Cornell students to roommates for the summer or post-graduation

Backend API: https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Housemate-Hunter-Backend-API--AcgyKyTL7V7sM8X27uWNebHrAg-et03mtePNtFhv6Rhyqplt

A roommate matching app, where users can create a profile and enter their preferences by factors such as budget, sleeping time and cleanliness. This appâ€™s target audience is Cornell students and its purpose is to match users for housing during summers and after graduation! On the main page, users will see a complete list of Cornell students registered on the app, and they can search people by name or graduation year. In the bottom right corner, users can input all of their person information, such as a bio, fun fact, their sleep schedule, cleanliness, and more!

### Requirements:

iOS:
- AutoLayout and NSLayoutConstraint is used
- CollectionView is used to display all of the other users
- UINavigationController is used to display profile information of each user
- API was not connected, read below

Backend:
- Designed an API using tables to model Users, their Locations, and Matches between potential roommates
- Used Flask and SQLAlchemy to create database and api endpoints
- Tailored return results from API calls to the needs of the iOS portion of the app
- Deployed backend to Heroku
- Used PostgreSQL for compatability with Heroku

Note for grader:
Unfortunately, iOS was not able to connect the front end code to the database. We also have a matching button on the main collectionView that we intended to lead to a new collectionView of the most compatible people for the specific user based on their preferences. We tried to convert the profile images to base64 in order to store them in the database but were also unable to do that. All of that code is still in the files just commented out. We ended up just hard coding a few users in order to show how we intended the app to work! Even though we were unable to successfully complete the app, we are really happy with how the front end looks and it was a great learning experience!
